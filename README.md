# Geely-Auto-Car-Price-Prediction
Geely Auto, a Chinese automobile company aspires to enter the US market by setting up their manufacturing unit there and producing cars locally to give competition to their US and European counterparts.

It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables.
They can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. 
Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
The aim is to built model and perform residual analysis, and make predictions on the test set. 
Also, calculate the R-squared score on the test set. This can be done using Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning techniques.
